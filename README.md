## Idea
Using the `MVC Pattern` I created this fully `Responsive` game where the player must find two matching cards to win. Only using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. CSS Animations are used for background lighting. Cards are sorted randomly at the beginning of the game. Clicked card is revealed while others hidden.


## Technologies
`JavaScript` `HTML5` `CSS3` `CSS Animations` `Flexbox` `GIT` `Github Pages`

## External Libraries
`vanilla-tilt.js` `formsubmit.co`
